# Prime-Number-Calculator
This program consists of two different programs that calculate the prime number that is closest to and is less than a given number ‘n’. ‘n’ is inputted from the user. The first program checks for non-prime numbers until the number n itself whereas the second one checks until the square root of the number. We then compare the time taken for both programs to execute.
